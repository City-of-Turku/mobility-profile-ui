The Mobility Profile UI

## Requirements

Using following:

- Node LTS (v18)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app by starting node server using build files.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>

## How to use

For development:

- Make sure npm packages are installed by running `npm install`in project root.
- Make sure you have environment variables set. `.env.example` should have all required values so you can copy it to `.env`.
- Then you can start development server using `npm start`. Which watches files and updates on code changes.
